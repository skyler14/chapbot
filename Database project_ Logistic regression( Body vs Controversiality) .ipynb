He will roll back the reforms of the Bolivarian revolution. \\n\\n&gt; And of course even if he had run and have gained traction, which he probably would have, the election commission would have disqualified him.\\n\\nI don’t necessarily believe that. They had a chance to negotiate an internally mediated solution. They left the negotiating table right before the deal was signed. \\n\\n&gt; The PSUV will be able to run in the election.  Many overtures have been made to them.  They are allowed a seat at the table.  Maduro could run but he'd get blown out.\\n\\nMaduro won’t be able to run. No guarantees have been made to that.

They are supplying the Saudis with weapons, they are refuelling their jets, they are enforcing the blockade with their navy that has starved at least 85 thousand children, they are supplying them with intelligence, Erik Prince\\'s mercs are there, they provide political backing that keeps the genocide ongoing instead of stopping it. They have the power to end the suffering, but choose to participate in it instead.\\n\\n&gt; The US hasn\\'t done anything in Libya since the ousting of Gaddafi\\n\\nYes, they supported a bunch of jihadi extremists to overthrow the government of Libya, with no plan afterwards. And then watched as chaos filled the power vacuum. It got so bad that open slave markets started appearing, and hundreds of thousands of refugees escaped to Europe through the chaotic, unprotected Libyan coast. Now they support an authoritarian fella called Haftar, who is currently engaged in sieging the capital city in an attempt to overthrow the internationally recognised Libyan government.\\n\\nJust because you are ignorant of whats going on around the world, doesnt mean the US is not doing anything.\\n\\n&gt; The US hasn\\'t done shit in Palestine\\n\\nThe US has unconditionally supported Israel at the UN, even as it continuously expands into Palestinian territory, even as it brutally occupies Palestinian land and murders them with impunity. They could very easily apply pressure on the Israelis to come to peaceful terms with the Arabs. Instead they choose to buddy up with Israel as it continues its ethnic cleansing campaign.\\n\\nJust like the US did nothing about Apartheid South Africa and was allied to it for decades. Until enough public pressure caused them to sanction the Apartheid government, and within months, it was finished and justice was restored. They could do the same in Israel to end the conflict, but take Israel\\'s side and protect it nonstop, exacerbating the conflict and hatred for decades.\\n\\n&gt; The fact that a possible war with Iran is seen as an \"evil act\" is ludicrous\\n\\nIt is an evil act. You are instigating another war for no reason. Iran signed the nuclear deal and was abiding by it. The US tore it up, reinstated sanctions to cripple the economy and now threatens it with war. You are upping the tension, and pushing us to the brink of another war. And you are conveniently forgetting all the hell you brought to Iraq with your WMD lies. half a million dead, and ISIS rising as a result.\\n\\nYou are also forgetting Syria, where you armed savage jihadis to overthrow another government you didnt like. Another few hundred thousand dead because of your hubris.\\n\\nThere is more I could go on about, but you get the picture. The US is a destructive and massively destabilising force in the region. Along with its buddies the Saudis (who promote the ideology that creates ISIS recruits) and the Israelis, who have started more wars in the region than I can count. \\n\\nLearn about your countrys role in the region.

For example, the authors point out how nationality is historically proven to be a significantly more important factor in a people’s values than their religion.\\n\\n&gt; Historically Catholic or Protestant or Islamic societies show very distinctive values, but the differences between Catholics and Protestants and Muslims within given societies proved relatively small. For example, the basic values of German Catholics were closer to those of German Protestants than they were to those of Catholics in other countries: the German Catholics were much more German than Catholic. The same is true in the U.S., Switzerland, The Netherlands and other religiously mixed societies: Catholics tend to be slightly more traditional than their Protestant compatriots in these countries, but they do not fall into the historically Catholic cultural zone or anywhere near it. Rather surprisingly, this also holds true of the differences between Hindus and Muslims in India; and Christians and Muslims in Nigeria: the basic values of Nigerian Muslims are closer to those of their Christian compatriots than they are to those of Indian Muslims. Similar patterns exist for other variables as well: educational, generational, occupational and ethnic differences on the two value dimensions of traditional versus secular‐rational authority and survival versus self‐expression values are much smaller within than between societies. Living in a given country has a stronger impact on people’s belief systems than their specific type of faith, lending support to the integration theory.\\n\\nYou’re incredibly lazy response quotes one paragraph from one **theory** on multiculturalism as if it invalidates the rest of the findings and arguments made within the paper. You then quote another paragraph from the section on theories supporting integration and immediately write it off as “biased” with no effort to refute the sources. How is the paper biased for providing theories on BOTH arguments? Your comment that I initially replied to suggested that you were open to evidence to the contrary of anti-integration beliefs, but you immediately wrote the article off just because you didn’t like what you’re reading. You’ve still made NO effort to cite your own belief “Muslim migrants actually tend to become *more* conservative once they're living in a country that isn't Muslim majority” while making incredibly weak attempts to refute the contrary arguments that I have provided you.\",\n",

Nope. “Cakes?”, absolutely.\\n\\nIt’s completely subjective, but it doesn’t matter as VAT applies to the vast majority of goods.\\n\\nThe point of the 2k versus 3k Mark was to show how millionaires pay nothing compared to your poor in relative scale. 3k to someone making 300k a year means nothing to someone making 50k a year and paying 2k. That’s why flat taxes favour the rich, which was exactly the point. \\n\\nYou also seem to have confused LBTT - the tax on buying a house - with council tax in the aforementioned claims. \\n\\nHere’s the breakdown: LBTT is much higher on established homes because it has a historic value, ie the previous sale price. However, land costs are not associated with LBTT, and new houses have no established value - just the cost for building, So if you build a house for 250k then add 200k in extensions on your 250k worth of land, guess which one of these three figures you pay LBTT on? \\n\\nPointing out first time buyers getting their first house without LBTT seems an odd choice. First time buyers are usually buying cheaper houses - so the LBTT cost will be pretty low for the coupon they’re burning. Likely, it wouldn’t have been anything notable so your point seems moot. But, sure, that average professional buying a 250k flat in Scotland or Northern England would save a whole 2% of their sale.\\n\\nThe point was it brings nothing substantial to the UK government so it is unnecessary.\\nIt’s also still a barrier to people buying houses, particularly when you could just tax the relative value of the home - like most other countries do. \\n\\nAlso, you’re right in pointing out it’s only 3/4 UK countries; it doesn’t apply to 4m of the UKs 60m+ population, if you don’t include the first time buyers there who may want to, perish the though, move elsewhere in the UK.',\n",

It isn't a matter of Space, it is a matter of lack of desire to have kids.\\n\\n&gt;Nuclear Plants are more expensive AND take longer\\n\\nNot in the 50's they didn't.  The US went from 0 to 50% power generation by Nuclear in 5 years.  FIVE, that is historical fact.  France went from 0 to 75% in 10 years in the 80's.  **It is more than possible, it has happened**.  Your argument is bullshit.\\n\\n&gt;so what does that have to do with anything?\\n\\nIt means that you can't offset the natural energy growth by continuing to do what you are doing, even with the massive solar boom that occurred in the last three years.  There just isn't enough power yield.\\n\\n&gt;Thats already the case, even without carbon taxes\\n\\nIt is the case right now in certain counties, it is not the case for the countries that run almost exclusively off of Coal and Oil.  I.E. South America, Middle East, and Africa.  Heck it needs to be so much better that not a single coal or oil plant is built anywhere, even in Europe.  Maybe that means Europe becomes the supplier of world power and get rich doing it.\\n\\n&gt;Every issue is already fixed with renewables.\\n\\nExcept the one where it will be **freaken 2100 before Europe** is able to completely transition from fossil fuels and start exporting exclusively green power.  It is NOT Feasible.\\n\\n&gt;Solar has even more advantages\\n\\nI don't care about the advantages they give, I care about one specific thing: solving the Earth's Climate Problems which renewables have not been able to do.  That is the Problem that determines whether or not we loose the planet or genocide half the population.\\n\\nAny other perk is worthless if there is no air to breath.\\n\\n&gt;Its better to remove coal and nuclear subsidize\\n\\nAgain you have no idea what you are talking about.  Renewables have 2x more subsidies than either Nuclear or fossil.  Even if you cut Nuclear and fossil subsidies and added them to renewable subidies you wouldn't increase the renewable subsidies by more than 100%.

An economic migrant is a person who travels from one country or area to another in order to improve their standard of living.\\n\\n&gt;What is an asylum seeker? A person who has left their home country as a political refugee and is seeking asylum in another.\\n\\n&gt; What is a refugee?

However, if they do not stay in the initial European country they reached, and instead stay in another, then they become an economic migrant from a European country.\\n\\nFurther, if a refugee is to flee their country, only pass through other war torn countries, and then stay in the first European country they reach, they remain a refugee.\\n\\nDo you agree that these examples fit with your given definitions? If not, could you explain why?\\n\\nEdit: Okay, no response. Assuming you agree, I'd have to point out that the logical basis you've created in order to continue arguing your position is absurd; and an example of mental gymnastics to fit an agenda; not useful and rational thoughts.

There are only maybe 9,000 Jews in Austria as opposed to the 300,000 pre-Holocaust, maybe a few thousand Sikhs. There are ~500,000 Muslims. That's maybe 4% of the population, so not huge but not invisible by any means.\\n\\n2.

They've hindered NK's arms programs and have made them have to reach out when their economy is really struggling. Sanctions are why NK has been begging to come to the table for decades.\\n\\n&gt;I can tell you, we didn't win the hearts and minds of the people in Vietnam by bombing the shit out of them, blockading them, and sanctioning them.

Why is Trump doing this with NK but threatening war with Iran who has been completely compliant to the deal they made while NK has done the opposite?\\n\\n&gt;It's shocking to me, and I don't say this as hyperbole, that you don't see sanctions and cutting off resources to innocent people as an aggressive maneuver of any kind. Please, and I'm not saying this to be mean, I mean it genuinely from the heart, stop and consider what you are saying.\\n\\n&gt;We love to wrap horrific acts up in pretty words, but call it by what it is: a siege.

The plastic reusables sold in the grocery store aisles need to be used 40~ times to reach impact parity with a single-use plastic bag.

If you want to actually make a difference, you'll need to be using them for significantly longer. Plastic-based reusables seem like a poor choice in that scenario, as they just won't last for longer than a month or two of regular use before they break(and might wind up getting thrown away much sooner, for example if meat leaks on trip #2, since you can't put them in the washing machine). Fabric bags are a good choice if you're handy with a sewing machine, but so many people aren't. Most of us don't even own sewing machines. I'm lucky in that I do know how to use one at a basic level, but I don't own one. My mom owns one, and a coworker owns one, and those are my two choices if I want to sew or repair something.\\n\\nIt's not what people want to hear, but the numbers suggest that, if you don't have the ability or motivation to care for a fabric tote(so easily 50%+ of the population, remember we're working with reality and not the ideal), single-use plastic is the most efficient choice provided you dispose of it properly(recycling, or reused in place of another plastic(trash liner, pooper scooper, etc)).

It will be expensive and the government of Nepal and the outfitters will have to forego some profits or charge more for licensing. IMO, that is where the real challenge lies - nobody is willing to dip into their share of the pie. There is no real monetary motivation.

I don\\'t know, it\\'s strange, abnormal, may be Christianity played a role in this, but anyway, such freedom for police means that UK is anti-liberal country, like Iran with a total control of society and they allow such activity which is one the law-edge (as least), is not it?',\n",

Your parents are out of the picture but you have a good support network from your grandparents. Obviously they can't be there the whole time but are willing to help out when they can. You can only afford to live in a low income area which is riddled with crime. While escorting some of your siblings to school, there is a driveby shooting and two of them are killed. In your mind, you know for a fact who did it. You take the correct response in seeking justice and the suspect is apprehended by the police. After two weeks of questioning, the police are unable to find any information linking the suspect to the murder of your two little brothers. But you know that motherfucker did it and he knows who else was involved. Because of your new job, you somehow get slotted to take this murderer back his home so he can play with his kids and help out his family all the while yours is broken and still recovering from the traumatic loss of two little brothers. Grandma and Grandpa say just take him home and keep going on with your life. There is nothing you can do about it now. But wait, there is something you can do. You can get him to confess and give you more information about the murder. You and another one of your siblings take control of this piece of shit and put him in an incredibly vulnerable state and then proceed to ask questions. You're not getting the answers you wanted but you know he's guilty. Put the gun to his head, that'll work. *Suspect moves when you look away.

Inquisitive maybe.\\n\\nEven the people you are saying we should listen to are wanting to do exactly the same thing you said should never be done -- somebody challenging the leading model is just another way of saying \"They want to change the model based on the data\" lol. Which is again fine! (if their new model is better that is, which currently it isn\\'t according to experts)\\n\\nSuch challenges are forbidden and lies are uncovered but denied.  How do you expect people to start believing if there is great alarmism instead of explanation of facts and challenges.  This is where the “science” of global warming differs from actual science.  People who just bring up valid points are called “science deniers” instead of actually answering the question.  Science needs to be proven before it is scientific law, unproven science is just theory.  We are told that global warming is not theory but it keeps changing like the NOAA data so it is more theoretical than law\\n\\nif their new model is better that is, which currently it isn\\'t according to experts\\n\\nWho are these “experts”?  Bill Nye?  Al Gore? AOC?  They are certainly the loudest and foul mouthed.  Does filthy language and alarmism give them a science degree?',\n",

The type of trespass like types of murder mean very different things in UK law.\\n\\nThough it is a crime in other countries so maybe thats your confusion.\\n\\nYou're thinking of aggregated trespassing or refusing to leave when asked which can be a police matter etc.  But she was neither of these things.  She walked in and and as there was no security she had a right to be there. She didn't break anything or steal anything and she didn't refuse to leave.   She committed no crime in the UK.  This is a fact you can check.\\n\\nPls google before speaking false statements as truth.\\n\\nI wasn't the bouncer but thanks for asking lol I was the manager.  \\n\\nThe manager learns all aspects of his business  so he can not only do his job well but help his employees to do their work.  He should have an understanding of all aspects and be willing to do every job including security.  So yes it does give a trained professional an intrinsic understanding of human  behaviour and acts of random violence (sadly).  \\n\\nBut this is only my opinion based on experince while your comment is opinion based on a mistake :?

       "['&gt; Um, do you practice law? I beg to differ. If I have a slam dunk case in front of me, I relish in the opportunity to utterly demolish the defense in front of a jury. The only time I\\'m settling a golden goose case is if the differential in the settlement agreement is equivalent to what it would have cost to go to court and charge my client attorney\\'s fees and increased contingency. \\n\\nThis is your stance, not a general one. \"Slam dunk case\"? \"Demolish the defense\"? That\\'s movie talk.\\n\\n&gt; Unfortunately for your argument, neither of these are relevant. This isn\\'t a criminal proceeding eating up state tax dollars and it\\'s not a suit against a corporation in which has PR at stake.\\n\\nA flight blown up in the air hasn\\'t got any criminal aspects? US has not got any pride?\\n\\n&gt; If I were on the Iranian counsel, this would be much more than monetary relief. Receiving a judgement against the United States, even if unenforced, is the ultimate victory. It allows the international court of opinion to look disfavorably upon the US, seeing them as hypocritical in their \"pen over sword\" approach. It undermines the relationship the US has with their lukewarm allies, making those allies more suspicious and distrusting of the US and hopefully more favorable to Iran. \\n\\nYou really have no experience with a legal system. Receiving a judgement is never guaranteed, even in your so called \"slam dunk cases\". Nor is a nation at war concerned with international opinion of an unrelated nation, especially from a court with limited power. Please get at the very least some second-hand experience of law before making such grandiose, idealistic arguments.\\n\\n&gt; I\\'m make no claim of being profound or intelligent in this strategy. In fact, it\\'s quite obvious. Because Iran did not take this strategy, it\\'s telling of faults within their version of the fact pattern. They knew they didn\\'t have airtight evidence to support their version of events and thus opted to at least get some money out of the issue.\\n\\nOnce again, you demonstrate your inexperience. A settlement doesn\\'t indicate guilt or innocence of either party. That\\'s one of the main points of having a settlement in the first place.',\n",

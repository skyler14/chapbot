The insights are almost always worth my reading. (I\\'m a folklorist who has begun to think and write about similar topics starting from the humanistic perspective -- the dearth of interesting work by humanists on technology is just surprising. I\\'m a little, okay a lot, embarrassed for the academy.)\\r\\n\\r\\nI come to reddit from reading Graham\\'s essays -- and thanks to Slashdot for first turning me onto Graham! And I\\'m glad I clicked on the \"comment\" link, because I think a lot of people have raised important qualifications to Graham\\'s schema. Most of these qualifications point out that all those B-level operations still must get done. The fallouts are: \\r\\n\\r\\n* Individuals who do only C and never B tasks in fact defer those tasks to others. This is possible in a work environment where there is a staff to handle those B tasks -- which is an interesting conundrum given Graham\\'s argument that staff hired to handle B tasks often in fact interrupt those who work on the C tasks and hired them in the first place in order to defer the B tasks. In a home environment, B task deferment falls to a partner, whom you can only hope doesn\\'t have C tasks of their own -- I know a lot of successful academics, mostly men, who have very (*very*) patient (and forgiving and a lot of other things) wives that tend to all the B tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Individuals who only focus on C tasks, while perhaps achieving some level of greatness (and/or recognition), are often individuals who are out of balance. They are, to put it less politely than some of the commentators here have, assholes. (Again, my experience in the academy gives me plenty of examples to call upon.) So, while we may admire their achievements, it\\'s often the case (not always) that we also recognize that they are miserable human beings, and plenty of people choose a \"more mediocre\" life but one of relative happiness (however you want to define the latter term).\\r\\n\\r\\n* Sometimes A and B tasks are integral to getting C tasks done.

While Web 2.0 is clearly a buzzword, it makes sense to analyze what the new breed of web apps have in common and is better than before. It is not just Ajax, democracy and be nice to users. One thing is he misses the APIs, but I think there is a better way to describe the difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially Web was about getting something out there that the whole world can use. There is one to many relationship between your site and its users. Economically the difference from old businesses is that your front desk cost now is easily available for anyone, and its cost is pretty much constant as the users grow. Your front desk is your site.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeb 2.0 is about using the network effects in your site. The more your site is used, the more beneficial it is for its users. Your site is not just a connection between you and your users, it is many-to-many connection between your users. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a lot like bringing network effects like the ones we know from instant messaging on a new platform - the Web. Why is the Web suitable for this? Because there are already acccumulated solid and general mechanisms that make the web work, and you can plug in yours more easily. If you use things like RSS, REST, JSON, etc it is also easier for others to plug in to you. This is how mashups come into play.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a lot like a preexposed and generalized democracy component. Being nice to users is necessary in the context of democracy, because in such environment minor usability enhancements have compound effect to the bottom line: that\\'s why Ajax is necessary. Now that extra effort to make the site a little more useful is actually worth it. You need to enable users to be effective in your democracy, because this affects the bottom line. You need to be easily reachable, which accounts for APIs, bookmarklets, backlink tracking etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I think democracy is a misnomer: political democracy is about voting, and have the majority win. Minority doesn\\'t get what it wants. It is quite a different mechanism that works with The Long Tail: everyone should get what is suitable for him. Most Web 2.0 applications are not quite there, but clearly this is the trend.\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S: It is an interesting thought experiment to imagine implementing a Long Tail kind of democracy politically.

If you only sold 1000 books, that $1 per book for each service, which is nowhere near the 20% of a $49.99 book.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the time I wrote this post, I've been contacted by a couple authors that self-published, and not one has lost money.  Granted, none of these books sold anywhere near 10 thousand copies, but most tech books barely sell more then 2500 copies.  They all made more then what the major publishers where willing to give them as an advance (which most authors know that is all they will ever see).\", 't3_21665', 'reddit.com', 2, 2, False, 0, 1135732834, False, 0, 'c2265']\n",

They can ask you to stop, but they can\\'t actually physically stop you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI agree completely with the author\\'s position -- if I pay for something, I\\'m done. I have no need for security cronies following me demanding I prove I\\'ve paid for it. \"Guilty until innocent\" doesn\\'t fly with me. Prove I stole something from you.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad I been in a similar position, the moment brute force (or the threat of such) was used to physically stop me from leaving, I\\'d have offered a single warning to move away from me and clear my vehicle\\'s path (inviting them to record my license plate but warning that a car weighs a *lot* more than a human). Then, if they\\'d refused, I\\'d have called the police myself, and pushed as hard as I could to have charges filed against everyone involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this really happened the way the author describes, the security minions at the store had already made so many mistakes in their handling of the situation that even if he *had* stolen the stuff, they\\'d have had major trouble getting charges to stick. It\\'s fine to follow the guy out to his car to ask him to return to the store. Everything that happened afterwards *isn\\'t*. Using your body to prevent a person from entering their car to leave is a form of detainment (unlawful at that). Using your body to block the vehicle\\'s departure is similarly detainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author really should have involved the police as soon as he saw the situation escalating. I, too, have shopped at stores that want to inspect my receipt at the exit. I\\'ve thanked them for their interest and walked past them without \"presenting my papers\" every single time. We do not (yet) live in a society where we\\'re guilty until we prove we\\'re not, and I refuse to submit to little power trips like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncidentally, you can still return something to a store that \"marks\" receipts they inspect at the door even without the little \"inspection mark.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis probably sounds nasty, but here\\'s the bottom line: shoplifting and theft at stores like this is *not* my problem.

While those goons were chasing after a paying customer, countless others walked out the front doors without a glance from the \"security\" guy who\\'s supposed to be pouncing people at the door for their receipts.

I understand there is a strong political motivation against statements like that, but sexuality is such a social and physiologically complex thing --more complex than a simple yes/no physical trait.

Plus, sexuality doesn\\'t seem to be a clean straight/gay division, so I think that a more homosexual-friendly society would give borderline people more options.

I didn\\'t try to claim that Java is the _best_ language for software engineering; I\\'m arguing that it has properties that make large codebases easier to manage, hence a better vehicle for teaching software engineering.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, functions reuse code, and every language has some idea of a function, subroutine, method, what have you, but I think that the standard library that comes with Java has much more to offer than what you get with other languages. You\\'ll notice that it is quite consistent in terms of naming conventions and other things, which is impressive for a library of its size. This is code reuse on a larger scale than we see in other languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother property that helps with managing large codebases is namespaces. Without namespaces, it is difficult to produce a large codebase and be certain that there won\\'t be naming collisions if you need to make it work with another large codebase (suppose your software company acquires another one, for example -- again, this isn\\'t a problem that you and your buddies face when hacking together -- I\\'m talking about something on a larger scale than that).\\r\\n\\r\\nI concede that the REPL is a huge tool, which is why I use the DrJava plugin for Eclipse when I use Java. I hate the name, but it allows me to execute Java statements and try things out without creating a throwaway class with a main() method. ([shamelessPlug]If you\\'re a JavaScript hacker, then you may want to check out my Chickenfoot extension for Firefox, which offers something of a REPL for JavaScript, plus a lot more[/shamelessPlug].)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tools for refactoring in Java have become very good (as I said, I use Eclipse), which is also important when it comes to managing large codebases. In most languages, if you want to rename a variable in your code, then you run perl minus pie to rename it everywhere, cross your fingers, and hope that you didn\\'t break anything. With tools like Eclipse, you can do that renaming such that you know that you haven\\'t changed the behavior of your program. (Renaming a variable may be a weak example, extracting methods/interfaces are more compelling refactorings that Eclipse can do, but it\\'s not as clear what the analogue is in some other languages, which is why I used the renaming example.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not to say that such refactoring tools could not exist in other languages (in particular, functional programming languages), but I haven\\'t seen them yet. Because Java is a bit of a control freak (to the dismay of \"Real Hackers\"), creating such tools is easier to do for Java. There is certainly a fair bit of research going on to make analogous tools in other languages, but until they come to fruition, I think that teaching Java with Eclipse is a better way to teach software engineering.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was a TA for 6.170 for three semesters at MIT, and I started the movement from Emacs to Eclipse. Since Eclipse made it so easy to run unit tests and interact with CVS, which I think are also important practices for a software developer, I thought it was clearly the way to go. As you can imagine, some students/faculty thought otherwise, but that\\'s a whole different discussion.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*For the record, no student (or faculty member :) was forced to use Eclipse in 6.170: students have always been free to use whatever tools they want. You can bet that we had, and will continue to have, die-hards who insist on using Emacs and checking in their code from the command line.

I guess that only leaves JavaScript without packages or namespaces, which a big pain, with respect to all the AJAX stuff going on recently.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of existing package/namespace systems, I can\\'t speak to all of the languages you list, but right now, I\\'m looking at the Java 1.5 API (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html), and I\\'m trying to compare it to the equivalent Python API to see how its packages are organized, but I\\'m not sure whether the Python Library Reference (http://docs.python.org/lib/lib.html) is what I\\'m looking for (if this is the right site, then Python\\'s packages sure appear more disorganized than Java\\'s.) Classes in Java packages can also have data members that can be only accessed by other classes in the same package -- I\\'m not sure if the languages you list add that ability as part of their package system.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, no, 6.170 students must code in Java for 6.170.

It was one of the first (if not the first) languages to focus on data abstraction and I\\'m told it had nice iterators and exception handling, so I suppose this was a good choice for 6.170 back in the day. My best guess as to why they switched to Java (in the late 90s, I believe) is that it looked like Java was going somewhere and CLU wasn\\'t (which certainly turned out to be true). Because of the switch, students have been able to make some fantastic final projects since they can leverage third-party libraries written in Java, such as OpenGL, which is a lot more fun than doing a project without such libraries. I also think it\\'s important that there is at least one course in the CS curriculum that exposes students to tools that people use in the real world (CVS, Eclipse) as opposed to tools that were made for and by MIT (Edwin the Scheme editor).', 't1_c2621', 'reddit.com', 5, 5, False, 0, 1136043341, False, 0, 'c2663']\n",

Despite killing millions of his fellow Chinese with his programs, he is still regarded by many with a great deal of admiration.  The Cult of Mao is quite penetrating.  Weighing in with the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cofficial Party stance\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d on Mao, Deng Xiaoping called him \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cseven parts right and three parts wrong.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\r\\n\\r\\nKinda makes you wonder what it would take for someone to be \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cten parts wrong.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, it should also be noted that Mao insisted on subordinates who acquiesced to his every request, regularly falsifying production quantities, orchestrating false demonstrations of \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0098model\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 work communes, etc. all elaborately manufactured to appease Mao.  Over the years, he became so ignorant to the realities of China\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s plight that much of the destruction he caused was not intentional, but rather a by-product of his own insularity.  Not that this excuses it, but it may broaden the perspective from which we view it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMao was also a great lover of Chinese Opera, but unbeknownst to him, the production being put on for him was set on the stage of China.\",\n",

I guess I must've missed the memo:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"WWI was actually caused by competition to exploit colonial resources, Germany's preemption of France as the major continental industrial power, Germany's attempt to build a competitor to the Royal Navy, and the entropic degradation of Bismarck's spiderwork of treaties when the Iron Chancellor himself was no longer around to manage them.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, let's ask an analogous question: &lt;i&gt;Seriously&lt;/i&gt;, what is the US doing in Iraq?\\r\\n\\r\\nI submit that the answer is likely to be more complicated than \\\"Chimpy McHitlerburton lied to us about weapons of mass distraction!  Michael Moore told me so!\\\"  Or, for that matter, \\\"We done gawne inter Eye-rack t' spread dumawkruhsee an' the Gospel t' th' heathen.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf WWI is entitled to a &lt;i&gt;serious&lt;/i&gt; causal examination, why isn't the Iraq war so entitled?  Answer: attempting to write HISTORY while it's still happening is called POLITICS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pompous toad in this article has declared Iraq a stupid war.  Fine.  What kind of evidence does he have to back up his reasoning?  How many soldiers' memoirs has he read (and deconstructed)?  How many Iraqi citizens has he interviewed?  How many members of the insurgency?  Or is he basing his judgements on reports from the western media (who have LESS information than the coalition's military leadership), and the Iraqi media in the run-up to a parliamentary election.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if you try to be objective under these circumstances, you're still going to reach conclusions that support the views you already hold.  Read Foulcault and Derrida if you don't believe me.  And then, if you have any kind of intellectual conscience, knock a point off this assinine submission so nobody has to see it again.\",\n",

For people in the U.S. to be farming does not make much sense, becuase they have access to better education and have more capital.\\r\\nPeople in Africa have nothing, they could use nature to farm, and thats about all they can do.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it would make sense for the Africans to do the farming and the US to build the websites to sell the farm produce.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Africans can not farm, because if they grew the produce they could not sell it to anyone, because the American stuff is already cheaper.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, in the real world things are not that simple, not everyone in the U.S. is rich or has access to good education, and not everyone in Africa is destitute (but most are) I painted a pretty simple picture with that theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore the situation in Africa is worse then this. There is no infrastructure because all the governments are so corrupt. Bill Gates could throw all the money in the world at the diseases, but nobody over there is really getting innoculated. Most of the scientists getting special education are leaving africa. It really is a bad situation, one that people should put more effort into being aware of.

Most people are just uneducated or ignorant or don't have time to learn or can't be bothered knowing or remembering everything. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, they are not retarded or mentally disabled, or even stupid.

And if you set the bar at 200, then you end up with a few hundred people voting on the future of millions. Which by itself ain't bad -- you just can't call that democracy anymore.\",\n",

When procedural code and raw data appear in object-oriented systems, figure out *first* whether it is the right solution. If it is, complain that the language does not support it better, not that it does not fit the artificial mold of object orientation. Quit pretending that OO is everything.

I am a lawyer, for instance.  Lawyers cannot patent or copyright their work, which leads to two pathologies.  Either (1) the work is made public and everyone gets to use it without paying the creator, or (2) the work is confidential and many customers who would be willing to pay for it don't get to because of the lawyer who knows the secret only has so much time in his day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat's why the best lawyers charge $800/ hr. and any lawyer can get away charging with $200/ hr.  Does anyone really think that the best of the best are only four times better than the guys who had to take the Bar exam three times to pass it?  That doesn't make much sense to me.  I also know that if I work as hard as a computer programmer in a start-up, I'll get a lot of billabe hours, but my work will be filed with the SEC where all the world can see &amp; copy it.

It concisely sums up how the economic world works in a way anyone could understand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept for one side argument.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems to me the article claims that for an economy to be successful it must let their wealth generators keep what they make.  That without this component the talented will have no incentive to create.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat may be the reason capitalism has been so successful, but are we sure our economy isn't just a local maximum?\\r\\n\\r\\nIs there really no other reason to create wealth?\\r\\n\\r\\nYou argue that without this incentive everyone's output will be reduced to the mean as it is in a big bureaucratic business.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut you also state that no-one really like working this slow and that an engineer would work their ass off on sexy projects like fighter jets.  Open source is another example that shows there has to be more incentives to a person than just building wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe big business can't get as much out of their troops because the only incentive they can give is money.  What if they no longer needed to provide this.  What if they were forced to find something else to give their employees.  Would they be able to motivate people better than they do now?\\r\\n\\r\\nGoogle has many top producers that no longer need personal wealth and yet they still seem to be innovating.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe capitalism works so well because it's easy.  Letting people keep what they create takes relatively little infrastructure.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, as the economy grows it seems to be getting harder.  We need more laws, more financial institutions, more cruft.  More wasted wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilding the infrastructure of a central economy without corruption is a hard, risky problem.  But maybe at some point it will be cheaper than what we have now.\",\n",

Other than the fact that the students would still have other classes to do and that they would be drawn from a single university, it sounds similar to SFP.  (modulo (diff Y-comb teacher)) \\r\\nThis would seem to be a step along the vector from normal angel investors to Y-combinator: you lower the cost of entry for the would-be entrepreneurs and give up some control.\\r\\nAs you lower barriers to entry into anything, you will tend to get a worse average but a better leadergroup.  Actually, that is not quite true-when you lower &lt;i&gt;uniform&lt;/i&gt; barriers to entry, that is the case.  When nonuniform barriers to entry are lowered, the average might go up too.      The university need not give the kids enough to live on-they already have dorms, etc..  Further, the universities need not get ANY of the company to make it worth their effort-they could take 1% of the company and give it to the instructors or something as part of the terms of the class, and thus guarantee that this class had the pick of the instructors, but they have no additional cost and hence no need to profit.\\r\\nIf the class was given over the summer semester, then it would get REALLY cheap for the colleges-they have excess housing for the summer anyway.\\r\\nSo other than their cluelessness, why don't the very best colleges do their own in-house Y-combs?  I bet Olin Shivers would do such a class, as would Robert Dewar at NYU, and Greenspun at MIT.\",\n",

Part of the reason things like J2EE got into such a mess was a concept of partitions roles: developers being just one part of the food chain. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn reality, a lot of the world is domainated by sysadmins, and J2EE and its ilk was a lot about giving deployment options back to them. Java itself does this by making the binaries cross platform, so the platform can change at the sysadmins whim.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some ways rails is back to the future in this regard. I think peter yared (active grid) is talking up the fact that linux is everywhere, and therefor linux is the platform, so maybe it is ultimately a non issue. But not in my8 world yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for rails, I think there are a few tools out there. I guess the trick is to automate it. Automate, automate, and then automate again. Ideally you will just run one command to deploy, one to undo that deployment if it all goes wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it will take time to mature I believe.\",\n",

No one can agree on the terms of the debate, though, so it will likely remain an unproductive argument.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrescod makes several unsubstantiated claims, in particular that an object is a \\\"better\\\" abstraction than a function, and that programmers do not like deeply nested expressions. The former statement strikes me as meaningless: some will program just as well with functions as others will with objects. The latter observation hints at the strange element of Lisp syntax that differentiates it from other programming languages: deeply-nested expressions.\\r\\n\\r\\n&gt; Most other languages don't have as many parentheses. Most other languages do not use prefix syntax. Glancing over a sheet of Lisp code and a sheet of Python code, what will strike you most is the difference in indentation. The Python code will have several more sections of statements at the same indentation level.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrescod claims that most programmers prefer this type of indentation. Of course, he has no data to back up this claim. I suspect that most programmers do like Python indentation more than they like Lisp indentation. The comparison is unfair, however, since most hackers start programming in a language other than Lisp.\",\n",

A great many minds have spent a lot of time on these topics and I think overall they haven't found the answers to be as simple as Paul makes them out to be.  I am not one of these scholars so I won't make the definitive critique but I can think of a few points:\\r\\n\\r\\nFamilies need stability as well as economic growth.  Paul's formula provides no way to even try to find the right balance.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tremendous amount of wealth is created by government funded research.  Think of all the medical research and the military funding of ARPA and missile programs (and transistors).  Paul's analysis has no good way to account for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a tremendous amount of wealth being create by the free/open source movement that cannot be accounted for by Paul's analysis.  The FOSS seems to be populated by socialist utopians from a bygone era.  Richard Stallman is a leftist of some kind and Linus Torvalds is from Finland, a &lt;i&gt;relatively&lt;/i&gt; socialistic country.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not really possible to prove why the industrial revolution happened where it did.  You can make reasoned arguments, but that's not the same thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need to explain why ancient Greek was able to create so much mathematics without any entrepreneurs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the age of nuclear weapons and genetic engineering we still need to be able to rein in some kinds of research. No entrepreneur will do that.  Unless one invents something...\\r\\n\\r\\nChange introduces instability and the danger of this is neither predictable nor controllable.  There is undeniable risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt isn't that so much of what Paul said was wrong is that there is so much else that needs to be explained and that none of it can be proven.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt must also be said that if it were not for the entrepreneurs not only would I not have a career but I would probably not be alive.  I'm not denying the positive side -- I'm saying the analysis Paul gives is just not enough.  It's version 0.1, not version 5.1.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n",

I might be wrong, however, but it seems that many of his assertions about \\\"Judeo-Christian\\\" seem to be only the ideas of Christianity, not Judaism at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as I can tell, he only makes two assertions about Judeo-Christian ideas, and both stem from Judaism and thus had a foundation in Christianity.\\r\\n\\r\\n&gt; Cain kills Abel, and we inherit the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cmark of Cain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, and the myth of Cain \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 the belief that we are all somehow murderers at bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis shows a misunderstanding of the core concepts behind that story. First of all, the only person to inherit the mark of Cain was Cain himself, and second of all, the Biblical story isn't that we are all murderers at the bottom, but rather sinners - whether that sin be greed, lust, idolatry, murder, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n&gt; Until the twentieth century, Judeo-Christianity tended to focus on the first one; the Serpent's apple, popularly if not theologically equated with the discovery of sexuality. But as sexual taboos have lost their old forbidding force, the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cmark of Cain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d has become relatively more important in the Judeo-Christian idea of \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009coriginal sin\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d. The same churches and synagogues that blessed \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cjust wars\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d in former centuries have become strongholds of ideological pacifism.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the only reason this is the case is not because theologically anything has changed, but rather politically the Catholic church isn't as powerful any longer and waging wars isn't in its best interest (I for the record am not a Catholic).\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd its interesting that the author says what he does, because until the 20th century, the fruit (it wasn't the Serpent's nor was it an apple), didn't really have to do with sexuality, but rather with a loss of innocence. The man and woman now were wise, and instead of simply wanting to obey God, they started worrying about the fact that they were naked, etc. The whole \\\"sexuality\\\" bit about the fruit has been a romantization of it over the past century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe article itself seems pretty valid, it probably would've helped his case to keep inaccurate statements about Christianity out of it, though.\",\n",

I don't know if this is usual in your country but in mine it is.\\r\\n\\r\\n- I procrastinated on cleaning. My house used to be a rat's paradise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end result is the fact that my lifestyle sucked. I had lots of stress, I was always afraid something bad will happen because of my sharp focus on what's important.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I decided to change. My current approach is that even if I have something important to do, such as interviewing and hiring a new developer, some things such as accounting, taking a shower, etc - always have #1 priority. I get these done as quickly and as efficiently as possible and then move on to what's really important.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince I took this decision my life is a lot better. I wear clean chlotes and I don't live in fear that an accounting audit will come and fine me a lot.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul Graham has a point in his article.

This, to me, is one of the many reasons the article is well-written.  Multiple meanings to multiple people.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiving in Rome, Italy, I'm kind of...out of the loop on some (most) of America's popular fixes/icons of the moment.  Hence, I don't know anything about Paul Graham...\\r\\n\\r\\nBut none of this takes away from the very plain, very obvious fact that GOOD AND BAD PROCRASTINATION is extremely well-written.

It depends on what the outcome of the project is. Adolf Hitler was deloused at the expense of the state in 1908 and was effectively destitute at that time. However, he rose to great power following WWI. There wasn't a lot of procrastination as he strove towards his big project's goal. In short, there's a moral aspect to what we work on.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) \\\"Are you working on the most important problems in your field?\\\". Having spent many years in scientific research myself, I have to ask the question: \\\"who decides what the important problems are?\\\". Thomas Gold was right on the money for some problems that weren't even on the radar screens of his peers! Of course, he also had some spectacular misses; but my point is that few institutions tolerate men like Thomas Gold.\\r\\n\\r\\n3) Many artists (and I include mathematicians, scientists and business people here too), successful or otherwise, are so self absorbed with themselves I find them both boring and fairly shitty people to work with, or just to be around them. Personally see some merit in, say, someone who puts the needs of his or her children first - in effect, making them \\\"Project 1\\\". Nor do I see it as inevitable that if you do so, that you cannot also be successful in other areas of your life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, I very much enjoyed Paul's essay as it put some of the main issues of procrastination into stark contast.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrew Sheppard\",\n",

Is there a better abstraction for solving these sorts of problems? I'm glad I use a language that allows other people to easily explore these questions.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI just wanted to say that I agree with this. However, you have to exercise care when designing macros that are used together with existing language constructs. Hidden parameters and the like break the user's expectation of Scheme's scoping mechanism, and should only be done if the alternative is way too inconvenient. If you are designing embedded DSLs using macros, the rules are totally different, of course.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, even if you take the macro route, it is considered good style to factor out as much as possible into functions to keep the macro definition minimal.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn your article you also mention that it's kind of inconvenient to have to specify 'yield' as a parameter to define-generator. If you are going for the baked-in feel, you can get around this by using non-hygienic macros, e.g. syntax-case macros (which most good Scheme systems support).\",\n",

      "    \"body\": \"What I find interesting about Graham's essays is that he so often approaches what are conventionally considered \\\"business\\\" or \\\"humanistic\\\" problems and approaches them from the point of view of a programmer who has a fair amount of business and life experience. The insights are almost always worth my reading. (I'm a folklorist who has begun to think and write about similar topics starting from the humanistic perspective -- the dearth of interesting work by humanists on technology is just surprising. I'm a little, okay a lot, embarrassed for the academy.)\\r\\n\\r\\nI come to reddit from reading Graham's essays -- and thanks to Slashdot for first turning me onto Graham! And I'm glad I clicked on the \\\"comment\\\" link, because I think a lot of people have raised important qualifications to Graham's schema. Most of these qualifications point out that all those B-level operations still must get done. The fallouts are: \\r\\n\\r\\n* Individuals who do only C and never B tasks in fact defer those tasks to others. This is possible in a work environment where there is a staff to handle those B tasks -- which is an interesting conundrum given Graham's argument that staff hired to handle B tasks often in fact interrupt those who work on the C tasks and hired them in the first place in order to defer the B tasks. In a home environment, B task deferment falls to a partner, whom you can only hope doesn't have C tasks of their own -- I know a lot of successful academics, mostly men, who have very (*very*) patient (and forgiving and a lot of other things) wives that tend to all the B tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Individuals who only focus on C tasks, while perhaps achieving some level of greatness (and/or recognition), are often individuals who are out of balance. They are, to put it less politely than some of the commentators here have, assholes. (Again, my experience in the academy gives me plenty of examples to call upon.) So, while we may admire their achievements, it's often the case (not always) that we also recognize that they are miserable human beings, and plenty of people choose a \\\"more mediocre\\\" life but one of relative happiness (however you want to define the latter term).\\r\\n\\r\\n* Sometimes A and B tasks are integral to getting C tasks done. As several posters put it, sometimes doing something else is a way of working on the C task you were \\\"supposed\\\" to be working on all along. Both the poet Wallace Stevens and the linguist Edward Sapir -- one an accountant and the other an insurance underwriter by occupation -- are reported to have gotten their best work done during long walks. So, C taskers who were occupied by B tasks who got their C tasks done while doing A tasks. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, my comment beyond my summary above is that the comments I read actually, many of which were by their own admission done as A or B level procrastination, actually made the composite essay a better one, which was one of Tim Berners-Lee's desires for the web in the first place. So my thanks to everyone for allowing me time and place to read and to think a little bit this morning while I gear up to do my own work.\",\n",

I would love to work on the \\\"big problems\\\" in my field. I am not afraid to tackle difficult problems. The way the world works today however, it seems that only projects that have early returns are viable. If you have a lot of money and you can work on whatever you want without worrying about money, then the essay is right on. But in the real world, if you want to work on a project you have to get funding. Good luck getting funding for a \\\"big project\\\" that promises results in 10 or more years! The ones giving you the money always want results every few months. You are forced to work on small problems just to prove that you are making progress. Even in academia, you have to work on small problems so that you can write a lot of papers. People seem to think that it's better if someone has written 30 \\\"small project\\\" papers than if he has written one \\\"large project\\\" paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be great if we could work on big projects, but the way corporations and academia work today, you cannot do that. You are forced to work on small projects to get results quickly in order to satisfy the ones giving you the money.\",\n",

      "    \"body\": \"I think Paul doesn't get the whole truth here. While Web 2.0 is clearly a buzzword, it makes sense to analyze what the new breed of web apps have in common and is better than before. It is not just Ajax, democracy and be nice to users. One thing is he misses the APIs, but I think there is a better way to describe the difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially Web was about getting something out there that the whole world can use. There is one to many relationship between your site and its users. Economically the difference from old businesses is that your front desk cost now is easily available for anyone, and its cost is pretty much constant as the users grow. Your front desk is your site.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeb 2.0 is about using the network effects in your site. The more your site is used, the more beneficial it is for its users. Your site is not just a connection between you and your users, it is many-to-many connection between your users. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a lot like bringing network effects like the ones we know from instant messaging on a new platform - the Web. Why is the Web suitable for this? Because there are already acccumulated solid and general mechanisms that make the web work, and you can plug in yours more easily. If you use things like RSS, REST, JSON, etc it is also easier for others to plug in to you. This is how mashups come into play.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a lot like a preexposed and generalized democracy component. Being nice to users is necessary in the context of democracy, because in such environment minor usability enhancements have compound effect to the bottom line: that's why Ajax is necessary. Now that extra effort to make the site a little more useful is actually worth it. You need to enable users to be effective in your democracy, because this affects the bottom line. You need to be easily reachable, which accounts for APIs, bookmarklets, backlink tracking etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I think democracy is a misnomer: political democracy is about voting, and have the majority win. Minority doesn't get what it wants. It is quite a different mechanism that works with The Long Tail: everyone should get what is suitable for him. Most Web 2.0 applications are not quite there, but clearly this is the trend.\\r\\n\\r\\nP.S: It is an interesting thought experiment to imagine implementing a Long Tail kind of democracy politically. Neal Stephenson envisions a world of small districts with radically different laws in \\\"Snow Crash\\\". But it is not necessary to divide the laws by land (so that you must obey different laws depending on your location). You may have rights, obligations and access to public services depending on a set of laws you choose to be yours (e.g. an important citeria would be the taxes you have to pay). There are numerious problems with this, of course.\",\n",

Instead, he was explaining something about procrastination as it relates to working on a great project.  It also didn't say that someone who completes a great project is a good person, or even a successful one.  A general theme of Paul's writing is great projects and how to succeed at working on one.  \\r\\n\\r\\n2)  The question wasn't saying that you should conform to what your peers think important questions are.  It meant more that, if you believe that what you're working on is less important than something else you could be working on, you should be working on the more important thing.  Thomas Gold probably thought what he was working on was one of the most important problems in his field, even if his peers didn't.  Also, Paul's essay is more focused inward, at how you can improve your own progress on great projects, not that you should try to convince others to do the same.\",\n",

Why so many more smart participants than, say, slashdot?\\r\\n\\r\\nanyway.  I'd just like to add that I've been reading Paul's essays for years now, and they've almost all been uniformly great. I can't even remember where I first encountered him.  I sent him an e-mail a few months ago, and he answered it, even though I'm sure he gets hundreds of e-mails per day.  I've been trying to think up a second e-mail topic that might be interesting enough to garner another reply, but I haven't yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose of you talking about exceptions to his putting-off-errands message are, perhaps, missing relevant experience to understand what he's talking about.  Someone said he had to put off A tasks such as interviewing programmers, for example, to do B-level errands.  I'm pretty sure that's not what Paul is talking about.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some types of work that are almost infinitely hard.  You can only work on such problems in long, uninterrupted stretches of time, and only when properly inspired.  Certain types of computer programming are that hard for me.  If I found myself in a mood to tackle one of those hard problems, then yeah, I would absolutely put off laundry, changing the oil in my car, paying the bills, or anything else to put the work behind me.  If your field doesn't require that sort of work from you, I guess I envy you a little bit, because it's really draining.  If so, you are perhaps not someone that Paul's essay applies to.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you guys like Paul Graham, you're also liable to like John McCarthy, the inventor of lisp.  I recently ran across this story he wrote which I found very enlightening, \\\"The Robot and the Baby.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/robotandbaby.html\\r\\n\\r\\nTruly excellent in all technical aspects, but it also demonstrates that understanding human beings is perhaps not McCarthy's strong suit.

Part of the reason I write blogs is to help with my writting skills, and you can see that I need it :).\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, when publishing a book, I could easily contract out that work, and save myself lots of money.  And it wouldn't be anything near the 20% pdxmph suggests.  Both proofreaders and tech reviewers are about $1000 each.  If you only sold 1000 books, that $1 per book for each service, which is nowhere near the 20% of a $49.99 book.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the time I wrote this post, I've been contacted by a couple authors that self-published, and not one has lost money.  Granted, none of these books sold anywhere near 10 thousand copies, but most tech books barely sell more then 2500 copies.  They all made more then what the major publishers where willing to give them as an advance (which most authors know that is all they will ever see).\",\n",

      "    \"body\": \"Meh; whether you're being \\\"an ass\\\" or not, the law's on the consumer's side (oddly enough). If you pay for membership at a store, like at a Sam's Club or a Costco, they can make \\\"must stop at door for receipt inspection\\\" a condition of membership. That's about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nA store anyone can shop at can't stop you at the door to check your receipt. They can ask you to stop, but they can't actually physically stop you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI agree completely with the author's position -- if I pay for something, I'm done. I have no need for security cronies following me demanding I prove I've paid for it. \\\"Guilty until innocent\\\" doesn't fly with me. Prove I stole something from you.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad I been in a similar position, the moment brute force (or the threat of such) was used to physically stop me from leaving, I'd have offered a single warning to move away from me and clear my vehicle's path (inviting them to record my license plate but warning that a car weighs a *lot* more than a human). Then, if they'd refused, I'd have called the police myself, and pushed as hard as I could to have charges filed against everyone involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this really happened the way the author describes, the security minions at the store had already made so many mistakes in their handling of the situation that even if he *had* stolen the stuff, they'd have had major trouble getting charges to stick. It's fine to follow the guy out to his car to ask him to return to the store. Everything that happened afterwards *isn't*. Using your body to prevent a person from entering their car to leave is a form of detainment (unlawful at that). Using your body to block the vehicle's departure is similarly detainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author really should have involved the police as soon as he saw the situation escalating. I, too, have shopped at stores that want to inspect my receipt at the exit. I've thanked them for their interest and walked past them without \\\"presenting my papers\\\" every single time. We do not (yet) live in a society where we're guilty until we prove we're not, and I refuse to submit to little power trips like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncidentally, you can still return something to a store that \\\"marks\\\" receipts they inspect at the door even without the little \\\"inspection mark.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis probably sounds nasty, but here's the bottom line: shoplifting and theft at stores like this is *not* my problem. I am not part of the problem, and I am not going to be a willing participant in your solution. If your inventory system is so broken that you really *do* have to count stuff sold as it goes out the door, upgrade your inventory system. If you have a rampant shoplifting problem, take effective steps to make identification and prosecution of thieves easier. You discourage theft by making it unprofitable and personally destructive to the thieves, not by inconveniencing and annoying your customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHassling people at the door is almost *never* successful and usually at least annoys people (and in this case, it was much worse), and when you try it with someone who actually knows their rights, you get incidents like this. While those goons were chasing after a paying customer, countless others walked out the front doors without a glance from the \\\"security\\\" guy who's supposed to be pouncing people at the door for their receipts. You can't show whether that let another thief out the door, but the customer the goons chased down turned right back around, and whipped out that receipt not for \\\"proof of purchase\\\" but for \\\"I want a refund, *now*\\\" purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe store lost a sale because of its behavior *after* it'd made the sale and the customer was *out the door*. That's pretty sad.\",\n",

In fact, he doesn't use the vi keybindings all that much.

I've never written a Java program, never more than glanced over reference books about it, but I have a hunch that it won't be a very successful language.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can you make a claim that Java isn't a successful language? You're going to back \\\"Java's cover\\\" by citing an article written in BusinessWeek? (Clearly BW is an authority on programming languages.) Did you even read the article -- the author clearly isn't a hacker (certainly not by your standards). If you read the comments at the end of the article, you'll see that someone rightfully called him on his distorted view of computer technology:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Given my reading of this article, I have my doubts that the author even understands the difference between an OS, a server, and a language. It's mostly nonsense to an actual programmer. Why does he repeatedly position open source software as an alternative to Java?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an example of how inane the BW article is:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The situation at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. (MER) in New York is telling. The investment bank runs many of its newer math-heavy applications -- such as options, futures, and derivatives -- using just Linux and the Apache server.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWow, they do all of that with just Linux and Apache? Apache 1.3 doesn't calculate derivatives for me -- I guess I need to upgrade to 2.2. Doesn't Merrill have to write any code to do all that math? This question probably didn't occur to the author because he *doesn't know any better.*\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to continue to defend \\\"Java's cover,\\\" then that's fine (there are some worthwhile points in there), but at least do so with some decent evidence. Speaking of which, did you notice these facts in the article:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"In North America, the percentage of developers who use Java as one of their principal programming languages declined to 47.9 in Evans' fall survey.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"IBM stands by its commitment to Java. Its WebSphere middleware is a multibillion-dollar business that grew 14% last quarter.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n47.9% of developers use Java as a principal programming langauge...a multibillion-dollar business built on Java...Hmm, Java isn't successful at all, is it?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf anyone deserves an apology here, I think it's Java.\\r\\n\",\n",

(blatant disclaimer)\\r\\n\\r\\nBut just some notes for discussion:\\r\\n\\r\\n2) I think that hanging around people who are openly gay makes people more likely to act gay. People tend to act like their peers. I understand there is a strong political motivation against statements like that, but sexuality is such a social and physiologically complex thing --more complex than a simple yes/no physical trait. It seems somehow demeaning, and at best, dishonest, to claim otherwise. I think we can all reasonably agree that social behavior is influenced by our social interactions. That sounds obvious to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimply, acceptable behavior is more expressed. Plus, sexuality doesn't seem to be a clean straight/gay division, so I think that a more homosexual-friendly society would give borderline people more options. That is, instead of only being willing to have straight relationships, they would be free to have homosexual ones, too. How is that unreasonable?\\r\\n\\r\\n3) Marrying a dog or a child or a car is absurd. But this still opens some interesting \\\"why not\\\" questions (for me at least, I'm a comp sci guy, not a law guy). If marriage is whatever consenting adults agree to, why not polygamy? Why not an 80 year old and a 20 year old (legal but frowned on). Why not a \\\"year free trial\\\" clause? Or a marriage subscription that must be renewed every 90 days? Why not?

Children are generally right to explore many things, and not worry too much about whether they are solving the hardest problems that exist, or not.  Any problem that helps them learn, even one other people have already solved, will do.  So the child playing video games instead of working on solving public good problems in economics, or even just learning calculus, probably isn't doing anything wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne parallel is that adults, too, shouldn't worry overly about solving the hardest problems that exist, as long as they are learning and making progress.  Working on the hardest problems a person can is all we can ever ask of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think it's worth considering what other parallels there are and how to unify the theories of how children and adults should look at hard problems and procrastination.\\r\\n\\r\\nElliot Temple\\r\\nhttp://www.curi.us/\",\n",

There is one issue that is a sticking point for me, the text reads, \\\"When I talk to people who've managed to make themselves work on big things, I find that all blow off errands, and all feel guilty about it. I don't think they should feel guilty.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is quite possible, but I think there may be a complex internalized strife where they are able to chanel the guilt and into the project.  For instance a person may feel guilty about not performing an errand and to further substantiate avoidance of that errand come up with critical questions that may be flung at their work.  An attempt to make the work as watertight as possible, against rebukes for not having performed other tasks, a sort of overcompensation.  Answering these questions then takes the person to the next level of development, one that might not have been achieved without the negative energy that is channeled into constructive (and sometimes obsessive) analysis of ones work.\",\n",

Thus, there is no feasible moral obligation to work as hard as is socially accepted.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, Russell argues, overworking ourselves at unpleasant tasks causes unuseful misery.  So, if we all worked less at our \\\"jobs\\\", we'd be happier and have more time and energy for enjoying ourselves.

I can't see how a high GPA and an elite school can fit that mold.

This is supposed to be part of what college is for, but since the CS depts are dropping the ball, there is a niche open for a sort of DeVry-for-cool-languages-and-techniques, where you can prove competence in scheme, haskell, asm, etc., instead of with java.  The placement rates post-graduation for such an institution would probably be excellent, assuming anyone passed.  I guess it would have to be set up like a certification or something similar, because the size of the student body would not justify a school-scale operation.  Perhaps local language organizations like LispNYC and Bothton would be the proper vehicle.\",\n",

However, I don't agree with their method of measuring peace by simply measuring the number of armed conflicts:\\r\\n\\r\\n&gt; By 2003, there were 40 percent fewer conflicts than \\r\\n&gt; in 1992. The deadliest conflicts -- those with 1,000 \\r\\n&gt; or more battle-deaths -- fell by some 80 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat's fine, but that doesn't tell me jack about the overall number of deaths and casualties.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat's worse -- 100 conflicts with 1,000 deaths each, or 20 conflicts with 30,000 deaths each? What's worse -- 100  minor terrorist attacks (say, anthrax letters), or a single terrorist attack with 3,000 deaths? And is a single World War with tens of millions dead better than 100 local wars with 1,000 deaths each?\\r\\n\\r\\nI really dunno. And actually, doing such cold math with human lives is kinda scary and distasteful, so that's not my point. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy point is that I would prefer that we measured peace not by measuring the number of conflicts you can be killed in, but rather by measuring your overall *chance* to avoid being involved into *any* conflict during your lifetime plus your *average chance of surviving a conflict* once you do get involved into one.\",\n",

It is fairly hard to support multiple-value-return, continuations are a bit of a bear, and fast function call interfaces such as those used by Ocaml are not possible (at least, not portably).  For something to be an assembler, you would want to be able to get at the stack, which you cannot do (directly) in C.  Java is even worse as an assembler, and it gets used as an assembler sometimes.  I dearly hope that it does not become the de facto standard assembly the way C has.  It limits implementors in much the same way that semantically poor languages limit the programmer, and limiting the implementors hurts all of us.\\r\\nAs to low-level teaching languages, perhaps it would be useful to have a teaching architecture, like MMIX or the apple II or the amiga-all of them are probably understandable by a single person, and they are all a lot simpler than most current chips.

It reminded me of a passage in the book I am currently reading, The Midnight Disease: http://books.google.com/books?q=the+midnight+disease\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book contains a whole section on procrastination [pp.114-117] and the passage I remembered is on page 117:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Attempts to improve 'time management' fail because the procrastinator generally knows exactly when he should be doing what, but simply cannot bring himself to do it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt struck me that this passage and Graham's essay point to the underlying problem with most procrastination (in my mind at least) of being overwhelmed/having the thoughts vacuumed out of one's head by the problem and rarely is the problem not knowing what needs to be done. \\r\\n\\r\\nPersonally, however, I find to-do lists helpful in both remembering which problems I currently have to work on. While I admit, often these include errands, they include the occasional 'big problem'/'big idea' and the attempted solution or implementation of the problem/idea inevitably gets worked out/outlined in a series of to-do lists. \\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps my definition of to-do list is a bit off, though. (Really in some cases, it is more of an outline)\\r\\n\\r\\nNonetheless, \\\"The Midnight Disease\\\" is a good book, and definitely a different sort of manual for writers. I think I'll return to reading it now, instead of posting muddle-headed comments.\",\n",

How much of a difference this makes will depend on how fast a rain drop falls and your front/top surface ratio, and I'm not doing the math.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Given that they were using fans, and weren't taking rain direction into account, this could be why the Mythbusters originally got it wrong)\",\n",

I'm a self taught programmer of seven years but I realize these deficiencies and so read books like \\\"Writing Great Code\\\" (by the inventor of High Level Assembler) and \\\"Database in Depth\\\" by C.J. Date, and thereby hope I differentiate myself from most of todays CS Grads.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you program in Java, you had damn well better understand pointers. Or rather, you had better understand Java's references, which are safer than C-style pointers but which still have the same potential for problems with referential transparency and weird side-effect mazes. This is important in almost all languages; you can only truly escape it if you use a purely functional language like Haskell, and then only if you don't use the special syntax for imitating side-effects with state-transition monads.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But I program in Java, and there are some \\\"weedout\\\" concepts, interfaces being the one that first springs to mind. I once heard interfaces called \\\"architecture enablers\\\" and maybe that is the difference between Java and the previous languages that were taught in CS courses.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou think that interfaces are a difficult concept to grasp? They just reflect the common OO practice of making similar objects support the same methods for certain purposes. They're not even the best way of doing it; why doesn't Java allow you to specify that some variable must implement *multiple* interfaces? Haskell's type classes, which are very similar to interfaces, allow this, so it can't be too difficult to type-check, and the syntax wouldn't be too hard to understand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Not having to worry about pointers allows one to more quickly get to the point of being able to 'architect' a solution.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGuess what? SICP, which uses Scheme as a teaching language, doesn't get to anything even vaguely pointer-like until chapter 3---and there are only 5 chapters. There are plenty of other languages which have less pointer crap to worry about than Java, and are easier to learn too, so students can get into the difficult concepts faster instead of dinking around with the syntax of a for loop.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour ignorance is showing, and you don't seem to realize it. Please, learn Scheme and ML. It should be an eye-opening experience for you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Just be sure you hire Java programmers who grok interfaces, and for heavens sake stay away from PHP coders!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAny Java programmer who doesn't even understand such a simple concept as interfaces shouldn't be hired, I agree. However, I fail to see the problem with PHP coders. If someone knows *only* PHP, of course they should probably be avoided, but PHP is a decent language for certain things. It's also terrifically easy to learn if you already know some other languages in the C family; I picked up enough PHP in a few minutes to write a simple database-and-email script, and I'm not a genius.\",\n",

It's just the jumping off point where he observes that more people are more familiar with Java than they used to be, why this is, and what he thinks it means.\",\n",

You enjoy your functional language and have great disdain for Java. I bet that those of you who hold that viewpoint don't work on many software projects that are too large for you to have written yourself, or on large bodies of legacy code where half of the original authors of the codebase are now at another company, so you can no longer ask them what their code does.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you start to find yourself in this situation, it's more helpful to do defensive programming than daredevil programming. A reference shouldn't be changed or a method shouldn't be overridden? Then declare it final in Java so the new guy who is working on the codebase can't override it. You can't do that in LISP because that's not LISP's philosophy: data and code are indistinguishable so nothing is really hidden if you cdr enough times.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, there are many ways to think abstractly; certainly pointers and recursion aren't the only ones.

And if this guy ever worked in one of these joints in his life before this, he would have handily disabused himself of this romantic farce. I love coffee, and cafes, and sitting in cafes drinking coffee while tinkering on my laptop, but I never pretend to want to run one of these places because I worked in one part-time in high school. It was stressful and bland and low-paying enough without having to worry about equity in the joint. But, when you're an overeducated, understimulated dilettante, I guess you have the time and money to dabble in this nonsense. Until, well, you have neither. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the nitwit has the gall to assume his myopic lower-east-side fantasy was a labor of love? Here's the difference between someone doing something they love and someone having a midlife crisis: When their first attempt fails, the lovers collect themselves, find some more money, and go do it again.

      "    \"body\": \"Personally, I would define software engineering as \\\"managing large software systems.\\\" And by large, I mean too big for an individual person to be completely familiar with. I didn't try to claim that Java is the _best_ language for software engineering; I'm arguing that it has properties that make large codebases easier to manage, hence a better vehicle for teaching software engineering.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, functions reuse code, and every language has some idea of a function, subroutine, method, what have you, but I think that the standard library that comes with Java has much more to offer than what you get with other languages. You'll notice that it is quite consistent in terms of naming conventions and other things, which is impressive for a library of its size. This is code reuse on a larger scale than we see in other languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother property that helps with managing large codebases is namespaces. Without namespaces, it is difficult to produce a large codebase and be certain that there won't be naming collisions if you need to make it work with another large codebase (suppose your software company acquires another one, for example -- again, this isn't a problem that you and your buddies face when hacking together -- I'm talking about something on a larger scale than that).\\r\\n\\r\\nI concede that the REPL is a huge tool, which is why I use the DrJava plugin for Eclipse when I use Java. I hate the name, but it allows me to execute Java statements and try things out without creating a throwaway class with a main() method. ([shamelessPlug]If you're a JavaScript hacker, then you may want to check out my Chickenfoot extension for Firefox, which offers something of a REPL for JavaScript, plus a lot more[/shamelessPlug].)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tools for refactoring in Java have become very good (as I said, I use Eclipse), which is also important when it comes to managing large codebases. In most languages, if you want to rename a variable in your code, then you run perl minus pie to rename it everywhere, cross your fingers, and hope that you didn't break anything. With tools like Eclipse, you can do that renaming such that you know that you haven't changed the behavior of your program. (Renaming a variable may be a weak example, extracting methods/interfaces are more compelling refactorings that Eclipse can do, but it's not as clear what the analogue is in some other languages, which is why I used the renaming example.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not to say that such refactoring tools could not exist in other languages (in particular, functional programming languages), but I haven't seen them yet. Because Java is a bit of a control freak (to the dismay of \\\"Real Hackers\\\"), creating such tools is easier to do for Java. There is certainly a fair bit of research going on to make analogous tools in other languages, but until they come to fruition, I think that teaching Java with Eclipse is a better way to teach software engineering.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was a TA for 6.170 for three semesters at MIT, and I started the movement from Emacs to Eclipse. Since Eclipse made it so easy to run unit tests and interact with CVS, which I think are also important practices for a software developer, I thought it was clearly the way to go. As you can imagine, some students/faculty thought otherwise, but that's a whole different discussion.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*For the record, no student (or faculty member :) was forced to use Eclipse in 6.170: students have always been free to use whatever tools they want. You can bet that we had, and will continue to have, die-hards who insist on using Emacs and checking in their code from the command line. I've forgotten the -kb flag enough times to convince me that it isn't the way to go, but that's just my opinion.\",\n",

      "    \"body\": \"Even Scheme, you say? Nifty. I guess that only leaves JavaScript without packages or namespaces, which a big pain, with respect to all the AJAX stuff going on recently.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of existing package/namespace systems, I can't speak to all of the languages you list, but right now, I'm looking at the Java 1.5 API (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html), and I'm trying to compare it to the equivalent Python API to see how its packages are organized, but I'm not sure whether the Python Library Reference (http://docs.python.org/lib/lib.html) is what I'm looking for (if this is the right site, then Python's packages sure appear more disorganized than Java's.) Classes in Java packages can also have data members that can be only accessed by other classes in the same package -- I'm not sure if the languages you list add that ability as part of their package system.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, no, 6.170 students must code in Java for 6.170. Grading student code is difficult enough as it is -- I can't imagine what it would be like if we let students write in any language. Such variety would be a nightmare for our automated test suite and the other tools we use to help with grading (which are written in Python, incidentally).\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't know what you mean by \\\"x,\\\" but I believe that the last language that was used for 6.170 was CLU, which is a language that was invented at MIT. It was one of the first (if not the first) languages to focus on data abstraction and I'm told it had nice iterators and exception handling, so I suppose this was a good choice for 6.170 back in the day. My best guess as to why they switched to Java (in the late 90s, I believe) is that it looked like Java was going somewhere and CLU wasn't (which certainly turned out to be true). Because of the switch, students have been able to make some fantastic final projects since they can leverage third-party libraries written in Java, such as OpenGL, which is a lot more fun than doing a project without such libraries. I also think it's important that there is at least one course in the CS curriculum that exposes students to tools that people use in the real world (CVS, Eclipse) as opposed to tools that were made for and by MIT (Edwin the Scheme editor).\",\n",

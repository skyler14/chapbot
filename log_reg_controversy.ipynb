Let me preface my comment by saying I always and only respect the results of studies carried out using the best available statistical methods which have been peer reviewed and preferably replicated.  I will tell you that you are a fool.\\n\\nYou don't appear to understand that studies are only approximations of reality and that because a study differentiates between, say, people 18-25 and 26-30, that the results of the 18-25 group are not necessarily representative of someone 26.  It actually worries me that you don't seem to understand this and that you may be giving advice to others as an expert.\\n\\nIt should be clear to you that the person being discussed would likely have benefited from vaccination regardless of the results of that specific study.  I want to know.  Do you dispute this?  Where do you work?  You are dangerously uninformed, and I am genuinely worried that you are not providing the best available care to your patients.\\n\\nI just reviewed the other comments on your account.

It doesn't mean they're wrong, but we don't know if they're right.\\n\\nMy point here is more that maybe if you don't know, don't think of yourself as an expert on it even if you're a doctor.  Consider yourself an expert in things we know and keep in mind that you're only best guesser for the rest, ya know?\\n\\n&gt;almost a century of widespread use.\\n\\nNo time at all.  Not remotely enough time to establish and destroy the golden age of antibiotics or learn anything from doing it.  :P\\n\\nA mountain of evidence about the effects of antibiotics on your patient won't tell you that kind of thing.  \\n\\nI mean, what in this mountain of evidence makes it plain that prescribing them at the drop of a hat won't have negative consequences down the road?  We might know that an unnecessary antibiotic won't hurt a patient or that continued use in the face of infection is absolutely worth and minor changes in mood much later on, but I find it hard to believe there's a mountain of evidence that it won't result in superbugs or something.\\n\\nIt's just one of those things where if we're wrong we're gonna find out the hard way.  It doesn't seem like we're trying to find out in a way that doesn't involve super AIDS wiping out the continent as the conclusion to the experiment.  :P\",\n",

A perfect example of this was the Nazis blaming Jewish people for all Germany’s problems, calling them trash and forcing them to wear armbands identifying themselves, almost like they were dogs wearing collars.\\n\\nThis same thing is currently being done by people like you and your ilk by labeling everyone and their grandmother who has any political views even slightly right of Stalin as fascists, white nationalists, Nazis or as you put it in your comment, pigs.\\n\\n**Step 2 is indirect violence.** The best example of this in history was Kristallnacht in Nazi Germany, where the SA and civilians damaged and destroyed tons of Jewish owned businesses.\\n\\nOnce again, this is already being done by the modern day leftist extremists, whether it be the massive destruction of property by the black bloc “protesters” (read as domestic terrorists) during the 2018 G7 summit or even more recently when a lawyer who represented ICE agents here in the States had his entire office flooded and destroyed by ANTIFA members.\\n\\n**Step 3 is direct violence.** This happened in Nazi Germany when Jewish people started getting attacked by civilians and soldiers, and eventually got sent off to the camps.\\n\\nThis step has once again been reached by leftists extremists, whether it be people like Eric Clanton who was beating people over the head with a bike lock, or the various people in Europe right now that are assaulting their political opponents by throwing milkshakes and even bricks at them.\\n\\n**Step 4... is mass killing.** It’s obvious when this happened in other reigns, with the gassing of Jewish people in Nazi germany, the execution of dissidents in the USSR, the mass killing of intellectuals in Cambodia, or what’s currently going on in Venezuela with the government running civilians over with tanks.\\n\\n\\nSo, whether you’re doing it intentionally or not (I’m not going to assume malice on your part, Hanlon’s Razor and all), you and your ilk are forwarding this process. There are plenty of people who have ideas and believes that I find to be revolting, but unlike you I don’t try to dehumanize those people cause I’m fully aware that can easily lead to horrible things occurring.\\n\\nAnyway, as I’ve said, I’m officially done arguing with you and your ilk, so once again, have a nice day.',\n",

       " \"Here is Hitlers speech from December 1940: \\n\\n&gt; I wish to put before you a few basic facts: The first is that in the capitalistic democratic world the most important principle of economy is that the people exist for trade and industry, and that these in turn exist for capital. We have reversed this principle by making capital exist for trade and industry, and trade and industry exist for the people. In other words, the people come first. Everything else is but a means to this end. When an economic system is not capable of feeding and clothing a people, then it is bad, regardless of whether a few hundred people say: 'As far as I am concerned it is good, excellent; my dividends are splendid.'\\n\\n&gt;However, the dividends do not interest me at all. Here we have drawn the line. They may then retort: 'Well, look here, that is just what we mean. You jeopardize liberty.'\\n\\n&gt;Yes, certainly, we jeopardize the liberty to profiteer at the expense of the community, and, if necessary, we even abolish it. British capitalists, to mention only one instance, can pocket dividends of 76, 80, 95, 140, and even 160 per cent from their armament industry. Naturally they say: 'If the German methods grow apace and should prove victorious, this sort of thing will stop.'\\n\\n&gt;They are perfectly right. I should never tolerate such a state of affairs. In my eyes, a 6 per cent dividend is sufficient. Even from this 6 per cent we deduct one-half and, as for the rest, we must have definite proof that it is invested in the interest of the country as a whole. In other words, no individual has the right to dispose arbitrarily of money which ought to be invested for the good of the country. If he disposes of it sensibly, well and good; if not, the National Socialist state will intervene.\\n\\n&gt;To take another instance, besides dividends there are the so-called directors' fees. You probably have no idea how appallingly active a board of directors is. Once a year its members have to make a journey. They have to go to the station, get into a first-class compartment and travel to some place or other. They arrive at an appointed office at about 10 or 11 A.M. There they must listen to a report. When the report has been read, they must listen to a few comments on it. They may be kept in their seats until 1 P.M. or even 2. Shortly after 2 o'clock they rise from their chairs and set out on their homeward journey, again, of course, traveling first class. It is hardly surprising that they claim 3,000, 4,000, or even 5,000 as compensation for this: Our directors formerly did the same - for what a lot of time it costs them! Such effort had to be made worth while! Of course, we have got rid of all this nonsense, which was merely veiled profiteering and even bribery. \\n\\nHe quite literally says National Socialism is the opposite of Capitalism. Bannon is a proponent of free markets. \\n\\nSo, Bannon is a Zionist who supports free markets. The only overlap between he and the NAZI's is they both wanted to limit immigration.\",\n",

In jus in bello, for example, military necessity justifies making military objectives, such as enemy combatants, the object of attack. So, an attack on enemy combatants that incidentally damages civilian property or civilians themselves would raise proportionality considerations.\\n\\nThe law of war recognizes that persons must assess the military necessity of an action based on the information available to them at that time; **they cannot be judged based on information that subsequently comes to light.**\\n\\nArtillerymen are constantly under review of proportionality and military necessity.\\n\\nAll CIVCAS during Operation PHANTOM FURY in which Civilians were not intentionally killed AND made the object of the attack were legally justified under these principles and therefore cannot be \"War Crimes\"\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis is why these decisions are made by lawyers and not by people who can\\'t even understand the basic principles of LOAC.',\n",

There exists no universally accepted rule for establishing a person’s identity as an Indian. The criteria for tribal membership differs from one tribe to the next. To determine a particular tribe’s criteria, one must contact that tribe directly. For its own purposes, the Bureau of the Census counts anyone an Indian who declares to be such. By recent counts, there are more than 2.4 million Native Americans, including Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians.\\n\\nWhy are Indians sometimes referred to as Native Americans?\\n\\nWhen referring to American Indians or Alaska Natives, it is appropriate to use the terms American Indians and Alaska Natives. These terms denote the cultural distinction between the indigenous people of the continental United States and those of Alaska. While the term “Native Americans” came into usage in the 1960s out of respect to American Indians and Alaska Natives, usage of the term has expanded to include all Native people of the United States and its territories, including Native Hawaiians and American Samoans.\\n\\nWhat is an Indian Tribe?\\n\\nAn Indian tribe was originally a body of people bound together by blood ties who were socially, politically, and religiously organized, who lived together in a defined territory and who spoke a common language or dialect. In the eyes of the U.S. government a body of people as described above must be officially recognized in order to be considered a tribe.\\n\\n------------\\n\\nI'm further Left than you, btw.

That is a nasty party of colonization and was a typical part of how the world was back then, that being said that does not make it any less a dark spot in canadian history.\\n\\nResidential schools are not a form of genocide.  Huff po tries to make the argument for **cultural** genocide (qualifiers are important) but unless first nation structures, books, cultural artifcats, religious institutions were also being systametically eliminated in an attempt to remove the culture from history, then residential schools (as atrocious as they were) were more of a step towards cultural genocide then the actual embodiement of it, itself.\\n\\n\\n* Link 2\\n\\nInercontinental Cry is about as biased as a source you can find.

It is a disgusting practice.\\n\\nBut there sterilization programs targeted impoverished and mentally defecient individuals (not my words), the majority of which were not aboriginal (but a disproportionate amount was).  In alberta 3000 people were sterilized through the program, but less then 25% were aboriginal (thats high, and thats gross, but that is not genocide on the attempt of ~~Canada~~ Alberta).\\n\\nIn BC those numbers reduce to about 1/10th of that and only target individuals from mental health facilities (which were certainly higher proprotionate aboriginal as inmates.  I\\'m not making the argument that racism didn\\'t exist, expecially in the 1930\\'s-70\\'s) that would be ridiculous.  \\n\\nI believe those are the only 2 provinces that had forced sterilization, and the numbers never passed 3500.

MacDonald\\'s policy of starving First Nations to death in order to make way for the western expansion of European settlers meets the criteria of genocide under the CPPCG.\\n\\nYup, ok.  This is 100% Genocide.\\n\\n&gt;Similarly, the entire residential school system also passes the genocide test, in particular if you consider the fact that the Department of Indian Affairs, headed by Duncan Campbell Scott, deliberately ignored the recommendations of Peter Bryce, Canada\\'s first Chief Medical Officer, regarding the spread of tuberculosis in the schools. Such willful disregard for the basic principles of public health constitutes an act of genocide by omission, if not deliberate commission\\n\\nNo. WTF genocide by ommission? Genocide is an active act, not a passive one.  Being racist, allowing people to die and failing to help a portion of a specific community is disgusting but not genocide.\\n\\n\\n&gt;Finally, we have the very recent and painful memory of forced removal of First Nations children from their families by Indian Agents which occurred in the 1960s, also known by the popular term \"Sixties Scoop.\" This is an act of genocide that clearly meets the CPPCG test, and also fell outside of the residential school system.\\n\\nThis is cetainly a contender.  I needed to read up on this more to have my opinion made up.  If this was done with the intent to \"properly educate\" these kids the correct culture, I would find this at least a resonable debate for genocide.

[...] Originally conceived by Christian churches and the **Canadian government** as an attempt to both educate and convert Indigenous youth and to integrate them into Canadian society, residential schools disrupted lives and communities, causing long-term problems among Indigenous peoples. Since the last residential school closed in 1996 [...] Students were isolated, their culture disparaged — removed from their homes and parents, separated from some of their siblings (the schools were segregated according to gender) and in some cases forbidden to speak their first language, even in letters home to their parents. The attempt to assimilate children began upon their arrival at the schools: their hair was cut (in the case of the boys), and they were stripped of their traditional clothes, while being assigned new uniforms — and often given new names. Christian missionary\\tstaff lavished time and attention on religious observances, often simultaneously denigrating Indigenous spiritual traditions.\\n\\n[Source](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/residential-schools)\\n\\nSo how could someone reconcile the historical reality of the Residential schools and the UN definition of a crime of Genocide and then say that there wasn\\'t at the very least an appearance of a genocide on the aboriginal people of Canada?
